## This repository, named "printf," is a collaboration project of two students of ALX Software Engineering: OUSSAMA KOURAICH & Awini Maxwell. The repository contains a custom function called "_printf," which emulates the functionality of the standard C library function "printf." This function allows for formatted output conversion and printing of data with various specifiers, such as characters, integers, strings, binary, octal, hexadecimal, pointers and more.
